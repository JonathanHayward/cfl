### TL;DR

### What is CFL?

You've tried CVS, SVN (Subversion), Git, Mercurial, and others. Isn't it
time to try a little more *green* of a distributed version control
system?

CFL is the first green distributed version control system (DVCS). Inspired
by "twisted but brilliant" compact fluorescent lights, CFL offers full DVCS
services at a download weight of a very green file size of just under 8k.
